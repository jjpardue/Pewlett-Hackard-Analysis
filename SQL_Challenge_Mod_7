# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## The Silver Tsunami 

The purpose of this analysis was to gain insight and understanding of Pewlett Hackard's current and upcoming attrition due to a "tsunami" of retirements within the organization, specifically as it pertains to departments. As well, we were tasked with garnering information for the company's succession plan and to view who, if any, would be eligible for a mentorship program.

In projecting which employees could be set to retire, we narrowed in on current employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. The following analyses are focused on said age demographic and we understand that current employees outside of that date range could, as well, decide to retire, albeit we believe the majority of attrition will take place within the aforementioned age group(s).

### Analysis No. 1
Number of retirees by title

Within the organization, there are a significant number of upcoming retirements that could occur based on age - in total, **90,398** staff members in various departments. We have broken this out per title, with Senior Engineering having the most number of suspected retirees. Knowing this overall number will assist department heads with planning for replacement and potentail stress on the team as they work to absorb the workflow.

When the data was initially pulled, we noted duplicate employees in the table because of their movement throughout the organization.

To solve this problem, we wrote SQL code to source out retiring employees' most recent title. This gave us a more accurate picture.

### Analysis No. 2
Mentorship Eligibility

In determining a specific group of staff members for mentorship eligibility, we focused soley on staff members whose birthdays fell between 01/01/1965 and 12/31/1965. The age difference of ten years compared to those potential retirees gave us a comfort level in that those on the mentorship list, generally speaking, have another 10+/- years in the worksforce and suspect that leadership would be more apt to invest training dollars into a team who would perhaps, statistically speaking, enjoy working another decade; again, our presumption, only.

Back to the numbers.

With nearly 1,550 staff members on this specific list eligible for the mentorship program and the number of retirees projected, we believe there will be a well-rounded mentor:mentee support system.

Per usualy, we will include all data tables for full review and are happy to assist in any other data sourcing that may be needed in the future. This project was exciting and we believe that it will provide great insight and subsequent preparation, as well as potentially wonderful opportunities for those stepping into new roles.

Thank you,
